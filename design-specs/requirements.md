# Brand Activations: Make Sponsorships Smarter

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a "Make Sponsorships Smarter" feature within our social media app. The feature aims to provide brands with meaningful insights about their sponsorships while maintaining a non-intrusive user experience.

## Problem Statement
Brands invest significantly in sponsorships but lack reliable methods to measure their effectiveness. Traditional methods like surveys are intrusive and yield low participation rates, while aggressive tracking raises privacy concerns. We need a solution that balances brands' need for insights with users' privacy and experience expectations.

## Objectives
1. Provide brands with actionable insights about sponsored event attendance
2. Measure product reception without disrupting user experience
3. Track post-event engagement and conversion metrics
4. Deliver authentic visual content of brand interactions
5. Create a closed-loop system to attribute purchases to sponsorships

## User Stories

### Brand Perspective
1. As a brand manager, I want to see demographic data of users who attended my sponsored event so I can verify my target audience was reached.
2. As a marketing director, I want to understand how users reacted to my product so I can improve future offerings.
3. As a brand strategist, I want to track post-event engagement so I can measure the sponsorship's impact on awareness.
4. As a content manager, I want to access authentic user-generated content from the event so I can repurpose it for marketing.
5. As a sales director, I want to attribute purchases to specific sponsorships so I can calculate ROI.

### User Perspective
1. As a user, I want to share my experience at events without feeling like I'm participating in market research.
2. As a user, I want control over how my data is used by brands.
3. As a user, I want to discover products relevant to my interests without intrusive advertising.
4. As a user, I want recognition or rewards when I help promote brands I genuinely like.
5. As a user, I want a seamless experience when transitioning from discovery to purchase.

## Functional Requirements

### Visual Content Collection
1. Create event-specific photo/video galleries brands can access
2. Implement AI tagging of brand products in user-generated content
